# odin-landing-page

This is a landing page project that will be built as part of The Odin Project course.

With HTML, terminal & CSS basics covered, I will be putting my knowledge in building a landing page for a fake business that has a minimalistic eerie feeling to it.

Oct 24th - The start of the project. Positioning of nav & main header.
