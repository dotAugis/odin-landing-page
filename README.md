# odin-landing-page

With HTML, terminal & CSS basics covered, I will be working with my new-found flexbox knowledge to build a landing page copy as part of The Odin Project course.

Post-completion notes:
Flexbox is a fun and powerful tool in creating layouts & moving page content around. Since finishing this project, I've learned quite a lot of different techniques and have already noted a good few things I would do differently if I had another go at this.
